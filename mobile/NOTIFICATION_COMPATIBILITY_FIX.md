# 🔧 Notification Package Compatibility Fix

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The build error was caused by a compatibility issue with `flutter_local_notifications` version 16.3.3, which had an ambiguous method reference in the Android compilation.

**Error:**
```
error: reference to bigLargeIcon is ambiguous
both method bigLargeIcon(Bitmap) in BigPictureStyle and method bigLargeIcon(Icon) in BigPictureStyle match
```

## 🛠️ Solution Applied

I've downgraded to a more stable version:

### **Updated pubspec.yaml:**
```yaml
dependencies:
  # Notifications
  flutter_local_notifications: ^14.0.0  # ← Downgraded from ^16.3.2
  timezone: ^0.9.0
```

### **Dependencies Installed:**
- ✅ `flutter_local_notifications: 14.1.5` (stable version)
- ✅ `timezone: ^0.9.0` (compatible version)
