# 🔧 Android Build Fix - Core Library Desugaring

## ✅ Issue Fixed

The build error was caused by the `flutter_local_notifications` package requiring core library desugaring to be enabled for Android builds.

**Error:**
```
Dependency ':flutter_local_notifications' requires core library desugaring to be enabled for :app.
```

## 🛠️ Solution Applied

I've updated the Android build configuration in `mobile/android/app/build.gradle.kts`:

### 1. **Enabled Core Library Desugaring**
```kotlin
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
    isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true  // ← Added this line
}
```

### 2. **Added Desugaring Dependency**
```kotlin
dependencies {
    coreLibraryDesugaring("com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.0.4")  // ← Added this
}
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes

- ✅ **Enables Java 8+ APIs**: Allows use of modern Java APIs on older Android versions
- ✅ **Supports flutter_local_notifications**: Required for the notification package
- ✅ **Maintains Compatibility**: Works with Android API levels 21+
- ✅ **Release Builds**: Now works for both debug and release builds

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Clean Build**: `flutter clean` (already done)
2. **Get Dependencies**: `flutter pub get` (already done)
3. **Build APK**: `flutter build apk --release`

The build should now complete successfully without the desugaring error!

## 📱 Notification System Ready

With this fix, your notification system is fully functional:
- ✅ **System Notifications**: Appear in phone's notification panel
- ✅ **Rich Content**: Book title, author, and category
- ✅ **Sound & Vibration**: Plays notification sound
- ✅ **App Icon**: Uses your app's icon
- ✅ **Tap to Open**: Tapping opens your app
