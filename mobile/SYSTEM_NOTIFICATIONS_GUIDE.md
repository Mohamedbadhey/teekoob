# 📱 System Notifications Implementation

## ✅ Confirmed: Notifications Appear in Phone's System Notification Panel

The notification system I've implemented **DOES** create real system notifications that appear in your phone's notification panel/tray, just like notifications from other apps (WhatsApp, Gmail, etc.).

## 🔔 How System Notifications Work

### What You'll See in Your Phone's Notification Panel:

```
📚 Book Reminder

```

### Key Features:
- ✅ **System Integration**: Uses `flutter_local_notifications` for native system notifications
- ✅ **Notification Panel**: Appears in phone's notification tray/panel
- ✅ **Lock Screen**: Shows on lock screen (if enabled)
- ✅ **Sound & Vibration**: Plays notification sound and vibrates
- ✅ **Rich Content**: Shows book title, author, and category
- ✅ **App Icon**: Uses your app's icon
