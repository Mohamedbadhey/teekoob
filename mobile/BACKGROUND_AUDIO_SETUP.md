# üéµ Background Audio Playback - Setup Complete

## ‚úÖ What Was Added

I've successfully implemented background audio playback with system media controls for your Teekoob app. Now when users play audiobooks or podcasts, they can:

1. **See media controls in the notification area** (even when app is closed)
2. **Control playback from the lock screen**
3. **Use system media controls** (Bluetooth headphones, Android Auto, etc.)
4. **View book cover art and title** in the notification
5. **Skip forward/backward** with system buttons

## üì¶ Changes Made

### 1. **Added `audio_service` Package**
- File: `mobile/pubspec.yaml`
- Added: `audio_service: ^0.18.12`
- This package handles background playback and system media controls

### 2. **Created Audio Handler Service**
- File: `mobile/lib/core/services/audio_handler_service.dart`
- This service manages:
  - Background audio playback
  - Media notification display
  - System media button controls (play, pause, skip)
  - Book metadata (title, author, cover art)

### 3. **Updated Audio Player Service**
- File: `mobile/lib/features/player/services/audio_player_service.dart`
