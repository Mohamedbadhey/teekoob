## Current Status

We have successfully:
1. **Fixed field name mismatches** between frontend, backend, and database
2. **Added comprehensive debugging** to both frontend and backend
3. **Fixed dropzone configuration** to reduce MIME type warnings
4. **Fixed field name inconsistencies** in BookFormPage:
   - `author` → `authors` (to match backend expectation)
   - `titleSomali` → `title_somali` (camelCase → snake_case)
   - `descriptionSomali` → `description_somali`
   - `publicationYear` → `publication_year`
   - `pageCount` → `page_count`
   - `durationMinutes` → `duration_minutes`
   - `ageGroup` → `age_group`
   - `isFree` → `is_free`
   - `isFeatured` → `is_featured`
   - `isNewRelease` → `is_new_release`
   - `isPopular` → `is_popular`
5. **Fixed MySQL compatibility** - removed `.returning()` which is not supported
6. **Fixed database primary key issue** - explicitly generating UUIDs for the id field
7. **Cleaned up all debugging logs** - system is now production-ready

## Database Primary Key Issue - RESOLVED ✅

**Error**: `Duplicate entry '' for key 'PRIMARY'`

**Root Cause**: The `id` field in the books table was not configured for auto-increment, causing MySQL to try to insert an empty string into the primary key field.

**Solution Applied**: 
- Added explicit UUID generation for the `id` field using `crypto.randomUUID()`
- This ensures each book gets a unique identifier regardless of database table configuration

**What We've Fixed**:
- ✅ Field names are now correct
- ✅ Data is being sent properly
- ✅ MySQL insert syntax is correct
- ✅ Empty string cleanup added
- ✅ **Primary key issue resolved** - UUIDs are now explicitly generated
- ✅ **Debugging cleaned up** - Code is now production-ready

## System Status: PRODUCTION READY ✅

**All major issues have been resolved:**
- ✅ **Field name mismatches** between frontend and backend
- ✅ **Author field mapping** issue
- ✅ **CamelCase vs snake_case** field name inconsistencies
- ✅ **MySQL compatibility** issue
- ✅ **Database primary key** auto-increment issue
- ✅ **Book creation flow** working end-to-end
- ✅ **Debugging logs cleaned up**

**The book creation system is now fully operational and production-ready!**
